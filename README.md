This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
Actually i'm a product manager at Caju and i'm trying to get some knowledge on development skills, that way i can improve my comunnocation with my engineer team. I've started with some Postman tutorials and the next step i want to build a local project to understand the main concepts we are using in our daily activities.
